        <h2>📜 Life Lessons</h2>
        <p>
          #1- Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is,
          never try. #2- Son, if you really want something in this life, you
          have to work for it. Now quiet! They’re about to announce the lottery
          numbers. #3- All my life I’ve had one dream, to achieve my many goals.
          #4- If something’s hard to do, then it’s not worth doing. #5- If at
          first you don’t succeed, give up.
        </p>

        <p>
          #6- Trying is the first step to failure. #7- No matter how good you
          are at something, there’s always about a million people better than
          you. #8- Beer: The cause of, and solution to, all of life’s problems.
          #9-Books are useless! I only ever read one book, “To Kill A
          Mockingbird,” and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill
          mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his
          skin… but what good does that do me?
        </p>

        <p>
          #10- Son, this is the only time I’m ever gonna say this. It is not
          okay to lose. #11- It’s not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a
          troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a
          day. #12- Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about
          yourself is by making someone else look bad. And I’m tired of making
          other people feel good about themselves.

          His job in Season 1, before promotion to safety inspector. It was
          unclear to everyone (including his employer and Homer himself). He
          called himself a "technical supervisor", others thought he was a
          "supervising technician". He was hired as part of "Project Bootstrap,"
          a government program to bring in unskilled workers implemented by the
          Ford administration.

          the check and sees his pay is "drastically" short. It appears as an
          itemized check with the following:
